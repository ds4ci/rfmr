Description: RFM (Recency, Frequency, & Monetary Value) is the classic direct
    marketing optimization method dating back to the 1990's. While the 
    original calculation methods were klugy, to say the least, the underlying
    marketing concepts are still sound today. In fact, recency and frequency
    are often top predictors in propensity to purchase or churn models.
    In addition to utility functions for calculating and visualization of RFM,
    we extend classic RFM with RFM based customer segmentation (including
    segment transition over time) and the handling of additional variables
    that measure customer engagement like "Breadth."
